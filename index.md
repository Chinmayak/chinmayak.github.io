## About

[Curriculum Vitae](/documents/Chinmaya_Kumar_cv.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. student at University of Chicago. My research interests lie at the intersection of development, political, and behavioral economics. Specifically, I am interested in studying agency problems in public sector organizations and identifying interventions that can improve state effectiveness. In addition, I am also interested in understanding the causes of the underrepresentation of minorities in leadership roles in firms, bureaucracies, and elected bodies. One unifying thread across these two themes is that I explicitly study the role of social identity in shaping individuals’ decisions and how that affects organizational effectiveness.

My research projects have been funded by several organizations including [NSF](), [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/), [BFI Development Economics Center](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/centers-programs/development-economics-center/), [The Weiss Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), [IGC](https://www.theigc.org/), and [Azim Premji Foundation](https://azimpremjifoundation.org/). 

I am on the 2022-23 job market and will be available for interviews.

## Job Market Paper
Kumar, Chinmaya, and [M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/). "Complaint Resolution Systems: Experimental Evidence from Rural India." [[PDF]](/research/jmp.pdf)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> We study whether access to complaint resolution systems can resolve hold-up problems in implementing public good projects. We run a field experiment involving 1629 low-caste local representatives who were unable to start public goods projects in their constituencies due to bureaucratic hurdles. We randomize offers to file complaints regarding public good project initiation on their behalf and track its effects. Our treatment leads to a 40 percentage points jump in complaint filing rate and is effective in improving project implementation: treated constituencies see a 26% rise in public good projects. We also find that the treatment increases project initiation in neighboring constituencies by 23%. Our analysis suggests that the mere threat of a formal complaint technology could cause project initiation in neighboring wards. However, resolution rates go down when multiple complaints are filed against the same higher bureaucrat. Surprisingly, treated representatives did not gain any electoral returns in the local elections held two years after the treatment..

[M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/), and Chinmaya Kumar. "The Distributional Consequences of Political Reservation." [[PDF]](/research/reservation_paper.pdf) Working Paper
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> A key goal of affirmative action policies is to reduce disparities between disadvantaged minority groups and others. We study one such policy: mandated political representation in favor
of low caste (Scheduled Castes/SC) groups in Bihar, India. Using a regression discontinuity design framework, we study how political reservation affects inter-group disparities in the short- and long-run. We show that political reservation in favor of SCs for the post of local government head (a) lowers SC-non-SC disparities in access to public goods in the short-run (5 years later) and long-run (13 years later), (b) lowers inter-group private asset inequality modestly in the short-run and substantially in the long-run (c) has no efficiency consequences in the short-run and (d) increases political participation and presence of low caste members in local government in the long-run. Turning to mechanisms, we show that government programs are better targeted towards low castes in reserved constituencies. Our results suggest a virtuous cycle between political representation and resource access, which reap significant benefits for minority groups in the long run.

"Selection, Sorting and Discrimination in Labor Supply Decisions: Experimental Evidence from India" 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Minorities are underrepresented in enterprise ownership and leadership positions in big firms. Why? This paper empirically investigates the role of one potential reason for this: discrimination against minority employers by subordinate workers. I embed a field experiment in the recruitment of entry-level workers by a set of firms based in India. The field experiment aims to answer two main research questions: 1) Do minority employers face discrimination from below in labor markets? 2) What are the underlying motivations? I specifically test for two potential motives: attention discrimination and social image concerns. Preliminary results show that applicants are 30% less likely to apply for jobs advertised by minority employers. I also find strong evidence for ‘attention discrimination’ against minority employers.

"Persistent Prejudice: De-Biasing and the Demand for News", with [Christopher Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com/), [Leonardo Bursztyn](https://home.uchicago.edu/bursztyn/index.html), Kailash Rajah, [Chris Roth](https://sites.google.com/site/chrisrotheconomics/home) 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Identity groups often hold incorrect and biased beliefs about competing groups. These beliefs may be persistent and difficult to correct. Why is that? We hypothesize that people exposed to information counter to their group identity may work to re-bias themselves by increasing their selective exposure--their consumption of biased news and information. We design an experiment in which we randomly provide Hindu respondents with information to correct a biased belief about Muslims using informational videos. We first confirm that the videos shift their beliefs during the experiment. We then examine their demand for new information—having been de-biased, are they more likely to seek information from a biased source?

"Leader Led Growth: Social Identity and performance of Economic Enterprises in Rural India", with [M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Misallocation of entrepreneurial talent can prevent the economy from achieving its growth potential. Minority groups face discrimination across multiple markets – capital, product, labor – that limits the entry and growth of their enterprises. This paper empirically investigates whether exposure to low caste (Scheduled Castes/SC) leaders at the local level can help SC entrepreneurs overcome some of the barriers and improve the performance of their enterprises. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that exogenous exposure to SC leaders has a strong positive effect on the entry and growth of SC-run enterprises: There is a 20% increase in the number of enterprises and a 27% increase in workers employed by SC-owned enterprises. We find evidence for positive spillovers on mid-level caste groups (OBCs) but no effects on higher-caste groups. Using a primary survey of enterprises, we plan to uncover the underlying channels through which local leaders impact the performance of economic enterprises.
