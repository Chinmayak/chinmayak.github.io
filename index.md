## About

I am a Ph.D. student at University of Chicago. My research falls under two broad themes. First, I study how individuals' social identity shapes their decisions in a variety of settings such as labor markets, bureaucracy, and elected bodies. In particular, I attempt to empirically document discrimination against disadvantaged groups and uncover underlying motivations behind it. The second theme of my research is related to understanding the roots of low citizen participation and poor quality of public services delivery in weak institutional settings. More specifically, I examine how institutions such as the grievance redressal system can be used to encourage greater citizen participation and a more responsive state. 

My research projects have been funded by several organizations including [NSF](), [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/), [BFI Development Economics Center](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/centers-programs/development-economics-center/), [The Weiss Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), [IGC](https://www.theigc.org/), and [Azim Premji Foundation](https://azimpremjifoundation.org/). 

I am on the 2022-23 job market and will be available for interviews.

<details><summary markdown="span"><em>Abstract</em></summary>
A key goal of affirmative action policies is to reduce disparities between disadvantaged minority groups and others. We study one such policy: mandated political representation in favor
of low caste (Scheduled Castes/SC) groups in India. Using secondary data on public goods from
across 45,000 villages, private assets from over 17 million rural households, political candidacy
data from over 300,000 local jurisdictions and a primary survey of nearly 8,000 households from
Bihar, we study how political reservation affects inter-group disparities in the short- and long run.
Using a regression discontinuity design framework, we show that political reservation in
favor of SCs for the post of local government head (a) lowers SC-non-SC disparities in access to
public goods in the short-run (5 years later) and long-run (13 years later) (b) lowers inter-group
private asset inequality modestly in the short-run and substantially in the long-run (c) dampens
asset accumulation abilities of the dominant non-minority sub-castes in the short-run (d) has no
efficiency consequences in the short-run and (e) increases political participation and presence of
low caste members in local government in the long-run. Turning to mechanisms, we show that
government programs are better targeted towards low castes in reserved constituencies. Our
results suggest a virtuous cycle between political representation and resource access, which reap
significant benefits for minority groups in the long run.
