## About

[Curriculum Vitae](/documents/Chinmaya_Kumar_cv.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. student at University of Chicago. My research falls under two broad themes. First, I study how individuals' social identity shapes their decisions in a variety of settings such as labor markets, bureaucracy, and elected bodies. In particular, I attempt to empirically document discrimination against disadvantaged groups and uncover underlying motivations behind it. The second theme of my research is related to understanding the roots of low citizen participation and poor quality of public services delivery in weak institutional settings. More specifically, I examine how institutions such as the grievance redressal system can be used to encourage greater citizen participation and a more responsive state. 

My research projects have been funded by several organizations including [NSF](), [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/), [BFI Development Economics Center](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/centers-programs/development-economics-center/), [The Weiss Fund](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/), [IGC](https://www.theigc.org/), and [Azim Premji Foundation](https://azimpremjifoundation.org/). 

I am on the 2022-23 job market and will be available for interviews.

## Job Market Paper
Kumar, Chinmaya, and [M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/). ["Complaint Resolution Systems: Experimental Evidence from Rural India."](/research/jmp.pdf)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> We study whether access to complaint resolution systems can facilitate greater collaboration across different tiers of the state and improves the implementation of public goods projects. Taking advantage of the introduction of a new complaint resolution institution in the state of Bihar, we run a field experiment involving 1629 low-caste local representatives. We focus on representatives who were unable to start public goods projects in their constituencies due to bureaucratic hurdles. We randomize offers to file complaints regarding public good project initiation on their behalf and track its effects. Our treatment leads to a 40 percentage points jump in complaint filing rate. It is effective in improving project implementation: treated constituencies see a 26% rise in public good projects. We also find that the treatment increases project initiation in neighboring jurisdictions by 23%. Our analysis suggests that the mere threat of a formal complaint technology could cause project initiation in neighboring wards. Surprisingly, treated representatives do not gain any electoral returns in the local elections that were held two years after the treatment.

[M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/), and Chinmaya Kumar. ["The Distributional Consequences of Political Reservation."](/research/reservation_paper.pdf) Working Paper
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> A key goal of affirmative action policies is to reduce disparities between disadvantaged minority groups and others. We study one such policy: mandated political representation in favor
of low caste (Scheduled Castes/SC) groups in India. Using secondary data on public goods from
across 45,000 villages, private assets from over 17 million rural households, political candidacy
data from over 300,000 local jurisdictions and a primary survey of nearly 8,000 households from
Bihar, we study how political reservation affects inter-group disparities in the short- and long run.
Using a regression discontinuity design framework, we show that political reservation in
favor of SCs for the post of local government head (a) lowers SC-non-SC disparities in access to
public goods in the short-run (5 years later) and long-run (13 years later) (b) lowers inter-group
private asset inequality modestly in the short-run and substantially in the long-run (c) dampens
asset accumulation abilities of the dominant non-minority sub-castes in the short-run (d) has no
efficiency consequences in the short-run and (e) increases political participation and presence of
low caste members in local government in the long-run. Turning to mechanisms, we show that
government programs are better targeted towards low castes in reserved constituencies. Our
results suggest a virtuous cycle between political representation and resource access, which reap
significant benefits for minority groups in the long run.

"Selection, Sorting and Discrimination in Labor Supply Decisions: Experimental Evidence from India" 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Minorities are underrepresented in enterprise ownership and leadership positions in big firms. Why? This paper empirically investigates the role of one potential reason for this: discrimination against minority employers by subordinate workers. I embed a field experiment in the recruitment of entry-level workers by a set of firms based in India. The field experiment aims to answer two main research questions: 1) Do minority employers face discrimination from below in labor markets? 2) What are the underlying motivations? I specifically test for two potential motives: attention discrimination, social image concerns. Preliminary results show that applicants are 30% less likely to apply for jobs advertised by minority employers. I also find strong evidence for attention discrimination against minority employers.

"Persistent Prejudice: De-Biasing and the Demand for News", with [Christopher Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com/), [Leonardo Bursztyn](https://home.uchicago.edu/bursztyn/index.html), Kailash Rajah, [Chris Roth](https://sites.google.com/site/chrisrotheconomics/home) 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Identity groups often hold incorrect and biased beliefs about competing groups. Examples include Democrats and Republicans in the US, or Israelis and Arabs in the Middle East. In India, the setting for this study, Hindu nationalists commonly believe that Muslims are untrustworthy, or that the Muslim population is growing so fast that their population will overtake Hindus. These beliefs may be persistent and difficult to correct. Why is that? One reason, we hypothesize, is that people exposed to information counter to their group identity may work to re-bias themselves by increasing their selective exposure--their consumption of biased news and information. We design an experiment in which we randomly provide Hindu respondents with information to correct a biased belief about Muslims, using informational videos. We first confirm that the videos shift their beliefs during the experiment. We then examine their demand for new information—having been de-biased, are they more likely to seek information from a biased source?

"Leader Led Growth: Social Identity and performance of Economic Enterprises in Rural India", with [M. R. Sharan](https://www.mrsharan.com/)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> Misallocation of entrepreneurial talent can prevent the economy from achieving its growth potential. Minority groups face discrimination across multiple markets – capital, product, labor – that limits the entry and growth of minority-run enterprises. This paper empirically investigates whether exposure to minority leaders at the local level can help minority entrepreneurs overcome some of the barriers and improve the performance of their enterprises. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that exogenous exposure to minority leaders results in a strong positive effect on the entry and growth of minority-run enterprises: there is a 20% increase in the number of enterprises and a 27% increase in workers employed by minority-owned enterprises. We find evidence for positive spillover effects on social groups closer to status hierarchy but no effects on his-status social groups. Using a primary survey of enterprises, we plan to uncover the underlying channels through which local leaders impact the performance of economic enterprises.
